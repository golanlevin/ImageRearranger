    "1. Loads a collection of images (either as a zipped file, a directory, or in the form of a single mosaic image).\n",
    "2. Computes high-dimensional features which describe the images (either using an [image pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(image_processing)), or a neural network).\n",
    "3. [Reduces the dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction) of those features to a 2D point cloud (either using [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding))\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will need Python 3.11 or newer. *This notebook was developed with Python 3.13 on MacOSX 14.5.*\n",
    "  * First, **check** if Python3 is installed. Run: `python3 --version`\n",
    "  * If you see output like `Python 3.x.x`, then Python is installed. If not, install it via Homebrew: `brew install python`\n",
    "  * Then **verify**: `python3 --version`\n",
    "* **Download** [this repository](https://github.com/golanlevin/ImageRearranger):\n",
    "  * (**Option 1: Download as ZIP**) In GitHub, **click** on the green \"Code\" button in the upper right and **select** \"Download ZIP\" from the pulldown that appears). This will download a zip file to your computer. **Unzip** the compressed file. I recommend that you **rename** the folder to `ImageRearranger/`.\n",
    "  * (**Option 2: Clone via Git**) In your terminal, **navigate** to where you want to save the repository, and run this command to clone it: `git clone https://github.com/golanlevin/ImageRearranger.git`\n",
    "* At your Terminal prompt, **change directory** to that folder: `cd ImageRearranger`\n",
    "* Because this notebook requires the installation of numerous Python libraries, *working in a virtual environment (venv) is extremely strongly recommended*. **Create** a virtual environment, e.g. `mosaicVenv`:\n",
    "  * Mac: `python3 -m venv mosaicVenv`\n",
    "  * Win: `python -m venv mosaicVenv`\n",
    "* **Activate** the `mosaicVenv` virtual environment:\n",
    "  * Mac: `source mosaicVenv/bin/activate`\n",
    "  * Win: `mosaicVenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "* Before we install necessary libraries, it's optional but recommended that you **upgrade** pip first: `pip install --upgrade pip`\n",
    "* **Install** all required packages (making sure that `mosaicVenv` is activated first!): `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "  * This will install: `numpy scipy scikit-learn Pillow jupyter matplotlib opencv-python scikit-image umap-learn torch torchvision\n",
    "git+https://github.com/gatagat/lap.git`\n",
    "  * You won't need to re-install libraries the next time you activate the virtual environment.\n",
    "* You should now be able to **launch** the [ImageRearranger.ipynb](ImageRearranger.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook (if you haven't already) with `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "  * This will open `http://localhost:8888/tree`\n",
    "  * From there, **open** `http://localhost:8888/notebooks/ImageRearranger.ipynb`\n",
    "* **Step through** this notebook! You can step through this notebook using options in the Run menu. I recommend stepping through cell by cell with **Shift-Return**.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes you have already constructed the virtual environment, and installed the libraries, etc.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cd ImageRearranger` \n",
    "* `source mosaicVenv/bin/activate`\n",
    "* `jupyter notebook`\n",
